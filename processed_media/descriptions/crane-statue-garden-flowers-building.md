Here's a caption/alt text description for the image:

A vibrant garden scene unfolds before a light beige building with blue trim. The garden bed is densely packed with a variety of plants, showcasing a lush mix of textures and colors.  Bright yellow daylilies punctuate the greenery, standing out against the darker green hostas and the silvery-green foliage of another plant.  Purple clematis vines climb a trellis near a building's blue-framed window.  A silvery-grey metal crane statue is subtly positioned amidst the foliage, near the building's wall. The ground is covered with dark brown mulch and several grey rocks are visible. The overall color palette is a blend of deep greens, vibrant yellows, and soft purples, creating a visually appealing and peaceful garden atmosphere. The number "11" is visible on a plaque affixed to the building.
