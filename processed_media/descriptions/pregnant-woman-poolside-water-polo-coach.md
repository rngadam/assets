Here's a caption/alt text description for the image:

A pregnant woman wearing a light blue baseball cap, sunglasses, and a dark blue swimsuit stands smiling beside a table at an outdoor swimming pool.  She has her hands on her hips, showcasing her baby bump. The pool is bright blue, and several people are visible in the water, participating in what appears to be a water polo or similar aquatic activity. In the background, a large geodesic dome is partially visible, suggesting a park or outdoor recreational area.  A man in a light grey long-sleeved shirt and dark swim trunks is standing near the edge of the pool, seemingly overseeing the activity. The table holds papers, a cell phone, a water bottle, and a sports drink.  Yellow and blue lane dividers are stacked in the foreground to the right. The overall scene is bright, sunny, and conveys a sense of summer activity.
