A vibrant garden scene unfolds before a light beige building with blue trim. The garden bed is densely packed with a variety of plants, showcasing a lush mix of textures and colors.  Bright yellow daylilies punctuate the greenery, standing out against the darker green hostas and the silvery-green foliage of another plant.  Purple clematis vines climb a trellis near a building&#x27;s blue-framed window.  A silvery-grey metal crane statue is subtly positioned amidst the foliage, near the building&#x27;s wall. The ground is covered with dark brown mulch and several grey rocks are visible. The overall color palette is a blend of deep greens, vibrant yellows, and soft purples, creating a visually appealing and peaceful garden atmosphere. The number &quot;11&quot; is visible on a plaque affixed to the building." style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
