The document details match times, teams (identified by names like &quot;Vert Huard,&quot; &quot;CAMO,&quot; &quot;Nautilus,&quot; and &quot;GO-Fish&quot;), scores (e.g., 2-10, 4-3), court assignments (Court 1), refereeing assignments, and breaks.  The color scheme uses various colored boxes to visually distinguish teams and match times.  Handwritten notes in blue ink add details for the next year&#x27;s event, suggesting a pick-up time and setup. The overall color palette is primarily white and light grey, with blue, green, orange, and red accents used for team designations." style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
